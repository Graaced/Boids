Boids is an implementation of a flocking algorithm, inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks. 
This project is developed using C# and Visual Studio.

Features : 
- Flock Simulation: Reproduces the realistic behavior of a group of agents (boids) moving in a two-dimensional space.
  
Behavior Rules:
- Separation: Prevents boids from crowding together.
- Alignment: Steers boids towards the average direction of neighbors.
- Cohesion: Pulls boids towards the center of mass of neighbors.

Usage
Once the application is started, You can interact with the simulation by  spawning new boids by clicking the left mouse button.
